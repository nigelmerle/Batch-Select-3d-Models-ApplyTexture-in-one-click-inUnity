Tired of applying textures to so many models manually?

Introducing a simple Unity script that streamlines the process!

You can place this script anywhere in your asset folder. 

It creates a menu under 'Tools' called 'Batch Material Settings,' You have to batch select all your 3d models in your unity asset folder ex: obj,fbx..etc, highlight it and then you apply the material settings in just one click in the menu under tools. 

Make sure you have a texture folder ready next to your models.


What the script do ???

Here are the settings it changes and applies in the "material" tab of your 3D models



It sets material settings on selected 3d models to: 
       
      Material Creation Mode = Standard (Legacy)
      sRGB Albedo Colors  = true
      Location = Use External Materials (Legacy)
      Naming  = By Base Texture Name
      Search = Recursive-Up
